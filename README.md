# ml-to-decode-ads
The early stages of a Python-based system that analyzes digital advertising campaigns at scale

Using machine learning and large language models, we'll walk through the process of:

Using LLaMA to analyze ad content and imagery
Implementing clustering algorithms to identify patterns
Creating structured analyses of marketing approaches

This is a technical overview of the system architecture and implementation, not a marketing course. We'll look at how to use Python, sentence transformers, and AI to process thousands of ads and extract meaningful patterns.
Libraries/Technologies covered:

Python
Sentence Transformers
LLaMA
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NLTK
